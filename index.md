# About Me:

Hi! My name is Suha Sabi Hussain and welcome to my site. 

I’m a native New Yorker working on problems in machine learning, security, and privacy. Right now: 

1. I’m pursuing a BS in Computer Science (People & Intelligence) at [Georgia Tech](https://cc.gatech.edu/)

2. I’m conducting research on the privacy of Safe Browsing under [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) and the Georgia Tech Institute for Information Security & Privacy (IISP)

3. I’m a robotics software engineer at [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/teams/intelligent-ground-vehicle-competition/)

4. I’m contributing to several open-source projects, including CoronaTracker and OpenMined 

My other hobbies and interests include public policy, editing Wikipedia, comedy, food, film, urban exploration, microelectronics, linguistics, STS, and speculative fiction.
