My name is Suha Sabi Hussain and welcome to my personal webpage. 

# About Me:

I’m a native New Yorker working on problems in machine learning, security, and privacy. Right now: 

1. I’m pursuing a BS in Computer Science (People & Intelligence) at [Georgia Tech](https://cc.gatech.edu/)

2. I’m conducting research on the privacy of Safe Browsing under [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) and the Georgia Tech Institute for Information Security & Privacy (IISP)

3. I’m a robotics software engineer at [RoboJackets IGVC](https://robojackets.org/teams/intelligent-ground-vehicle-competition/)

Previously, I conducted research at the NYU Center for Cybersecurity, was a hardware engineering intern at Vengo Labs, and did some freelance engineering work. 

My resume can be found [here](https://sshussain.me/SH_R.pdf).
