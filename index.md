## About Me

[**I’m a security and privacy engineer primarily interested in machine learning, cryptography, and program analysis**](). Currently, I’m a security engineering intern at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). 

I’m pursuing a BS in Computer Science (Threads: [People](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/people) and [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence)) at [Georgia Tech](https://cc.gatech.edu/) where I conduct research under [Prof. Wenke Lee](https://wenke.gtisc.gatech.edu/). I’m also an electrical and software engineer on the [RoboJackets RoboNav Team](https://robojackets.org/teams/robonav/).

Much of my time is dedicated to maintaining [PrivacyRaven]()- a comprehensive privacy testing library for deep learning- and running the [DEFCON AI Village Privacy and Ethics Journal Club](). 

In addition to my professional pursuits, I’m quite interested in privacy and civil liberties issues, human-computer interaction, cultural studies, cyberpunk and postmodern media, world cuisines, 3D printing, writing, and martial arts.
